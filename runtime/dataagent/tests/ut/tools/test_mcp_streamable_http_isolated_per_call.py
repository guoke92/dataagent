"""Regression test for streamable-HTTP MCP cancellation safety.

Background: commit 2a4a9599 made ``MCPClientWrapper._execute_with_connection``
reuse a single streamable-HTTP session across calls. That change was safe for
resource-job coordinators (which own a dedicated event loop), but it broke
the tool-call path that runs on the LangGraph pregel event loop: when an outer
``astream`` cancel scope tears down, the MCP ``BaseSession`` / ``post_writer``
tasks can be left blocked on ``MemoryObjectSendStream.send`` while their
counterpart receiver is already closed, and ``ClientSession.__aexit__`` blocks
waiting for those tasks to settle.

The fix splits ``_execute_with_connection``'s streamable-http branch into two
modes:

- ``reuse_streamable_http_session=False`` (default, used by tool calls such as
  the DataOps prod adapter): each call opens and tears down its own
  ``httpx.AsyncClient`` / ``streamable_http_client`` / ``ClientSession`` inside
  nested ``async with`` blocks. Cancelling the calling task must propagate
  cleanly without hanging.
- ``reuse_streamable_http_session=True`` (used only by resource-job
  coordinators that pin a dedicated loop): the previous shared-session behavior
  is preserved.

This test exercises the ``False`` path with a live mock MCP server, cancels
the host task while a request is in flight at the wire level, and asserts
that the ``CancelledError`` propagates within a small bounded time. Without
the fix, the cancellation hangs on the MCP internal
``MemoryObjectSendStream.send``.

    Why raw ``session.send_request`` rather than ``session.call_tool``:
        ``call_tool`` returns once the wire round-trip completes; if the
        mock answers in microseconds the host task is already done before
        ``task.cancel()`` runs and there is nothing to cancel. Driving the
        request through ``send_request`` directly and using the mock's
        ``wait_sec`` knob to keep the server-side handler parked, we
        guarantee the request is still in-flight (the client future has
        not yet been resolved) at the moment we cancel — which is the
        exact regression window from the pregel astream bug.

    Why an ``asyncio.Event`` between the operation and the cancel point:
        We use ``in_flight`` as a sync point so the cancel fires strictly
        after ``send_request`` has parked on the wire, not at some
        arbitrary wall-clock offset. This eliminates flake from CI noise
        and from any future mock server becoming faster.

    Why we do not assert on the inner exception type:
        ``BaseSession.send_request`` parks on an anyio
        ``MemoryObjectSendStream`` / receiver pair. When the surrounding
        task is cancelled, the outer anyio task-group teardown closes
        those streams, which causes ``receive()`` to raise ``EndOfStream``
        (or an anyio-wrapped equivalent) inside ``send_request``'s
        ``finally`` rather than re-raising ``CancelledError``. The contract
        we care about is that ``ClientSession.__aexit__`` does not block
        on stranded ``post_writer`` tasks, so the host task must
        propagate ``CancelledError`` within the deadline regardless of
        what the inner ``send_request`` future settles with.
