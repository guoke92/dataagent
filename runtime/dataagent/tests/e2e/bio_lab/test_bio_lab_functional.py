"""Functional guard test for bio_lab HITL sentinel behavior.

This test verifies that when the XBB.1.5 pseudovirus sample (id=904036) is
**missing** from ``wet_samples`` (simulating the data inconsistency from
issue #5), the HITL sentinel mechanism (issue #6) correctly prevents the
planner from autonomously selecting an alternative pseudovirus and creating
the experiment without the user's explicit choice.

**Test scenario:**
1. Copy the source SQLite DB (which has the wet_samples row for 904036).
2. **Delete** the wet_samples row for id=904036 — this causes INNER JOIN
   with wet_samples to drop the XBB.1.5 sample, making it appear "not found".
3. Run the create_experiment query with 1 auto HITL response
   ("确认，请创建该中和实验" — an invalid answer that doesn't pick a
   specific pseudovirus).
4. Assert:
   - The experiment was **NOT** created in the DB (HITL sentinel blocked
     autonomous creation).
   - The sentinel text ("[SYSTEM] 用户连续 N 次未提供有效反馈") appears
     in the conversation messages.
   - The final answer does **NOT** claim the experiment was successfully
     created (the planner truthfully reports XBB.1.5 was not found).

This test complements ``test_performance.py`` (performance/cache-focused),
which asserts the experiment **IS** created when the data is consistent.
Together they guard both the happy path and the HITL-blocked path.
