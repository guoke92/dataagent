## 3. Feature Construction Process

> Recorded sub-task by sub-task as Phase 4 executes. Each entry includes: intent, code block, and observation.

### 3.1 Data Cleaning and Encoding *(SKILL.md Phase 4.1)*

**[Intent]** {{Describe what problem this step solves and why this strategy was chosen}}

```python
# {{Comment: what this code block does}}
{{actual executed code}}
```

**[Observation]** {{Key result after execution — e.g., "Missing values reduced to 0; encoding added 8 new columns"}}

---

### 3.2 Numeric Feature Transformation *(SKILL.md Phase 4.2)*

**[Intent]** {{Describe which skewed columns were detected and which transformation was applied}}

```python
{{actual executed code}}
```

**[Observation]** {{Result}}

---

### 3.3 Feature Combination *(SKILL.md Phase 4.3)*

**[Intent]** {{Describe which combination features were constructed and the rationale (business logic / correlation analysis)}}

```python
{{actual executed code}}
```

**[Observation]** {{Result}}

---

### 3.4 Time-Series Feature Construction *(SKILL.md Phase 4.4 — if triggered)*

**[Trigger]** {{Time column detected: {{col_name}}, data frequency: {{daily / hourly / monthly}}}}

**[Intent]** {{Describe which time-series features were constructed}}

```python
{{actual executed code}}
```

**[Observation]** {{Result — note how NaN in rolling features was handled}}

---

### 3.5 Multi-Table Join Features *(SKILL.md Phase 4.5 — if triggered)*

**[Trigger]** {{Multi-table input detected: {{table names}}, join key: {{join_key}}}}

**[Intent]** {{Describe which cross-table aggregation features were constructed}}

```python
{{actual executed code}}
```

**[Observation]** {{Result — note whether temporal leakage prevention was applied}}

---

### 3.6 Automatic Feature Mining *(SKILL.md Phase 4.6)*

**[Intent]** {{Describe whether mutual information or variance ranking was used, and which high-value combinations were found}}

```python
{{actual executed code}}
```

**[Observation]** {{Result — list retained combination features and their correlation improvement}}

---

## 4. Feature Evaluation and Selection

### 4.1 Filtering Summary

| Filtering Step | Features Removed | Examples |
|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| Correlation filter (Pearson > 0.95) | {{N}} | {{feature_a, feature_b, ...}} |
| Variance filter (variance < 0.01) | {{N}} | {{feature_c, ...}} |
| **Features after filtering** | — | **{{N}}** |

## 6. Reusable Code Index

The complete feature engineering pipeline code is at: `code/feature_pipeline.py`

**Function interface**:

```python
from feature_pipeline import run_feature_pipeline

# df: original DataFrame (same schema as used in this analysis)
# target_col: optional; target column name (affects encoding and evaluation strategy)
# Returns: processed DataFrame containing all final feature columns
features_df = run_feature_pipeline(df, target_col='{{TARGET_COL or None}}')
```

**Runtime dependencies**:

```
pandas >= 1.3.0
numpy >= 1.20.0
scikit-learn >= 0.24.0
matplotlib >= 3.3.0
seaborn >= 0.11.0
scipy >= 1.6.0         # Box-Cox / Yeo-Johnson
statsmodels >= 0.12.0  # Seasonal decomposition (required for time-series features)
```

**Deployment note**: `feature_pipeline.py` was generated from exploratory analysis on sampled data. Before deploying to production clusters:
- Re-fit all encoders and scalers on the full dataset
- For target encoding: fit on training set only to prevent test set leakage
- Adjust rolling window parameters for production data volume if needed
