def write_file(path: str, content: str, purpose: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Write a file to the local filesystem.

    Writes a file to the workspace. If the file already exists it will be
    overwritten; parent directories are created automatically.

    Usage:
    - Use absolute paths under the workspace root. Never write into skill
      directories or read-only roots.
    - This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the
      provided path.
    - If this is an existing file, you MUST use the read_file tool first to
      read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the
      file first.
    - Prefer the edit_file tool for modifying existing files — it only sends
      the diff. Only use this tool to create new files or for complete rewrites.
    - NEVER create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly
      requested by the user.
    - Keep ``content`` concise — ideally under 300 lines. For larger files,
      write a short skeleton first, then use edit_file to add sections
      incrementally. This avoids slow, token-heavy tool calls.

    Args:
        path (str): Absolute path under the workspace root for the file to create or overwrite.
        content (str): The content to write to the file.
        purpose (str): Brief description of why this file is being created/updated (required, non-empty).
