    Smoke-test argument injector for a builtin tool.

    The intended production use case for argument injectors is submit/job-service
    metadata injection, for example adding ``_job_envelope`` with plugin-owned
    routing metadata, private URLs, or credential references. That path requires
    ``LocalToolWrapper`` to consume governance-injected ``_job_envelope`` from
    tool args and merge it into ``ToolExecutionContext.job_envelope``.

    This Suite example uses ``create_plan`` only as a stable smoke target because
    it already declares ``_tool_context`` as an internal argument. The wrapper
    replaces the placeholder below with the real ``ToolExecutionContext``.
