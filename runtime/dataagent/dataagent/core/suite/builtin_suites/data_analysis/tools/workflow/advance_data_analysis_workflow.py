    """Advance the active DataAnalysis workflow using an explicit state-transition action.

    Use action="submit_current_step" only for a ready current step. Use
    action="complete_current_step" after the current step's subagent job reaches
    a terminal status; it completes successful jobs and records failed jobs or
    invalid receipts as failed workflow steps. Use
    action="retry_current_step" only when the current step is failed. A step can
    fail because its job failed, was cancelled, timed out, or because receipt
    validation/archival failed. For a read-only status check, use
    inspect_data_analysis_workflow instead. Do not call submit_subagent directly
    while a workflow is active.

    When resubmitting a retried step, optionally pass ``workspace_rel_path`` from
    ``search_workspaces`` / ``inspect_workspace`` (for example ``subagents/{id}``)
    to reuse that subagent workspace. Omit it to allocate a fresh workspace.

    Args:
        action: One of "submit_current_step", "complete_current_step", or
            "retry_current_step".
        job_id: Optional current step subagent job id. Required when completing a
            finished step; otherwise the current step job is used.
        retry_reason: Reason for retrying a failed current step.
        task: Optional override instruction when submitting a ready step. Leave
            empty to use the scenario-configured step target.
        timeout_sec: Maximum seconds for a newly submitted subagent job.
        workspace_rel_path: Optional relative path under the parent workspace used
            only with ``submit_current_step`` to reuse an existing subagent
            workspace. Leave empty to allocate a fresh workspace.
