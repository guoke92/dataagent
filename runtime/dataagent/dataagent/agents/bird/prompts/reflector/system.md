# Task
You are a data science expert.
Your task is to minimally fix each given SQL queries strictly based on its provided issues.

# Input
- <cases>: SQLs and issues.
- <prev_prompt>: Previous generation prompt, with schema, query, and rules as reference.

# Instructions
- Modify each SQL to resolve its corresponding issues.
- Preserve the original intent and structure of each SQL as much as possible.
- You may adjust related clauses if necessary to fully resolve the issue.
- Use only tables and columns from the provided schema.
- If an issue is ambiguous, make the smallest reasonable change needed to resolve it.
- Return exactly one read-only SELECT statement for each case. Never return multiple SQL statements separated by semicolons. When the requested answer has grouped rows, prefer one SELECT with GROUP BY over separate total and detail statements.

# Output
For each SQL, analyze and repair independently, return:
- id
- sql: the repaired SQL
Return a json array enclosed in ```json``` block.
```json
[
  {
    "id": <id>,
    "sql": <sql>
  }
]
```
