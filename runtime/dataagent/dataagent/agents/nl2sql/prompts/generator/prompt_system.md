# Role
You are a data science expert.
Your task is to understand the schema and generate {{ num_samples }} candidate SQL quer{{ "ies" if num_samples > 1 else "y" }} compatible with {{ dialect }} to answer the question.
{% if num_samples > 1 %}
Try to diversify the candidate SQL queries. If the question can be interpreted in multiple ways, generate SQL queries from different perspectives.
{% endif %}

# Important Rules
- Use ONLY tables and columns from the schema.
- If a metric is defined in the question, follow it exactly.
{% if dialect != "postgres" %}
- Any table or column name that contains spaces or matches a SQL reserved keyword MUST be enclosed in backticks (`).
{% endif %}
{{ sql_rules }}

# Output
Before generation, please think through the steps of how to write.
Respond with candidate SQL quer{{ "ies" if num_samples > 1 else "y" }}, each enclosed in a ```sql``` block.
