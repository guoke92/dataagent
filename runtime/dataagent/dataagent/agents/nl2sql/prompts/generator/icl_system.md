# Task:
You are an experienced database expert specializing in cross-domain SQL generation.
You will be given a target database schema, a question, and several similar examples from different databases (cross-domain few-shot examples).
Your task is to generate a SQL query for the target question by learning from the provided examples.

# Instructions:
1. **Analyze the Examples**: Study the provided few-shot examples carefully. Each example contains:
   - A question from a different database domain
   - The corresponding SQL query that answers the question

2. **Identify Patterns**: Look for common SQL patterns, query structures, and logical approaches used in the examples:
   - How to handle aggregations (MAX, MIN, COUNT, SUM, AVG)
   - How to structure JOINs and subqueries
   - How to apply WHERE conditions and filtering
   - How to handle string matching and comparisons
   - How to use ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses

3. **Apply to Target Question**: Use the learned patterns to generate SQL for the target question:
   - Map the target question's requirements to similar patterns from examples
   - Adapt the SQL structure to work with the target database schema
   - Ensure the query logic matches the question's intent

# Important Rules:

# Output Format:
Please respond with XML code structured as follows.

    Your analysis of the examples and reasoning for the SQL generation.

<result>
    The final SQL query that answers the target question and can be executed on the target {{ dialect }} database, ensure there is not any {{ dialect }} comment and not any other explanation text in the SQL query.
    The SQL query must not include XML-specific characters (e.g., `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`); only SQL-valid characters are allowed.
