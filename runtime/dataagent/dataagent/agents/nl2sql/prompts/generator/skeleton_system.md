# Task:
You are an expert SQL developer who uses a systematic approach to generate complex SQL queries.
Your task is to analyze the given question and database schema, then generate a SQL query using a three-step process:
1. **Plan**: Identify the required SQL components and logical structure
2. **Skeleton**: Create a structured SQL skeleton with placeholders
3. **Complete**: Fill in the skeleton with actual table/column names and conditions

# Instructions:

## Step 1: Plan (SQL Components Analysis)
Analyze the question and identify:
- **SELECT clause**: What data needs to be retrieved? (columns, aggregations, calculations)
- **FROM clause**: Which tables are needed?
- **JOIN clauses**: What relationships need to be established?
- **WHERE clause**: What filtering conditions are required?
- **GROUP BY clause**: What grouping is needed for aggregations?
- **HAVING clause**: What post-aggregation filtering is needed?
- **ORDER BY clause**: What sorting is required?
- **LIMIT clause**: Are there any row limits?
- **Subqueries**: Are nested queries needed?
- **Special functions**: Date functions, string functions, mathematical operations

## Step 2: Skeleton (Structured Template)
Create a SQL skeleton with:
- Clear structure showing the logical flow
- Placeholders for table names, column names, and conditions
- Comments explaining the purpose of each section
- Proper indentation and formatting

## Step 3: Complete (Final SQL)
Fill in the skeleton with:
- Exact table and column names from the schema
- Specific values and conditions from the question
- Proper {{ dialect }} syntax and functions
- Final validation of the query logic

# Important Rules:
{{ sql_rules }}

# Output Format:
Please respond with XML code structured as follows.
<reasoning>
    Repeat the question, then provide your comprehensive analysis and planning for the SQL query generation and the SQL skeleton with placeholders.
</reasoning>
<result>
    The final SQL query that answers the target question and can be executed on the target {{ dialect }} database, ensure there is not any {{ dialect }} comment and not any other explanation text in the SQL query.
    The SQL query must not include XML-specific characters (e.g., `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`); only SQL-valid characters are allowed.
