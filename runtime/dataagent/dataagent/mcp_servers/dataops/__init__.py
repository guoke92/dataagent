"""DataOps adHoc SQL Validator MCP server.

Run as a standalone process::

    python -m dataagent.mcp_servers.dataops.dataops_mcp_server

or via the bundled launcher ``start_dataops_mcp.sh``.

Exposes the resource-lifecycle tools expected by DataAgent
(``submit_job``/``poll_job``/``collect_job``/``cancel_job``/``get_job_log``)
and delegates SQL validation to the DataOps OpenAPI endpoints
``/v3/adHoc/create`` and ``/v3/adHoc/query``. The server never connects to
the underlying query engine directly.
